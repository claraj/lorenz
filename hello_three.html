//Needs 3x things: a scene, a camera, and a renderer (which renders the scene with the camera)

  var scene = new THREE.Scene();
  //Camera args:
  //A Frustrum is a cone or pyramid with two vertical planes cutting through it.
  // Represents the volume the camera sees.
  //Tip on side so camera looks through first plane at far plane(?). Only stuff between the planes gets rendered.
  //args:  vertical field of view ; aspect ratio (almost always width/heiht) ; near plane; far plane
  var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);

  //WebGL recommended renderer, others are for older browsers
  var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
  renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
  document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement);    // Adds a canvas element, style section makes this the size of the browser window

  //The points - shape of the object
  var geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
  //Material for the cube. Can do more complex materials
  var material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( { color: 0x00ffff } );
  //A mesh takes a geomery and applies a material to it
  var cube = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
  //And add tp the scene, by default at the origin (0, 0, 0);
  scene.add(cube);

  //The origin is where the camera is. So move the camera out a bit so can see the cube.
  //At this point, nothing to see....
  camera.position.z = 5;


  // ... because need a render loop that draws the scene at 60fps

  //This is called 60 times per second. 
  function render() {

    requestAnimationFrame(render);

    //Without this, the cube is not moving.
    cube.rotation.x += 0.01;

  render();

  //And now there's a cube.
